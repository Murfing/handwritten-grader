Deduct marks for answers that only discuss the village scenery or claim he became a 'big officer' without mentioning English."

Partial marks (1.5) if they only say 'he wanted to remain a bachelor' or 'didn't want a young girl'. 0 marks for saying he believed in love marriage regardless of caste/age (incorrect)."
